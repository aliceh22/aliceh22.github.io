        <div id="projects-txt-box">  <div id="txt"> <p class="white-big"> In 2012 I joined the Lloyds Scholars Program. The scheme, created by Lloyds Banking Group, is designed to support selected students from lower-income households through their undergraduate programs by providing them with mentorship, internships, skills-based events and encouraging them to volunteer in their local community. 
        <br/> <br/>
    The application process was rigorous but the scheme well worth it and I am very grateful for the experiences I had as a scholar. I lived and worked in two vibrant cities, gained a network of friends outside my University and was connected with opportunities I wouldn't have otherwise had. During the four years, I did over 400 hours of volunteering in and around Bristol which you can read about <a class="three" href="Volunteering.html">here</a>. 
    You can find out about the LLoyds Scholars Program on their <a class="three" href="https://www.lloyds-scholars.com/" target="_blank">website</a>. <br/> Details of internships below.

        <div id="projects-txt-box">  <div id="txt"> <p class="white-big"> In Edinburgh I worked with the B.O.S. Scottish Small and Medium Enterprises team. They were a close-knit group that cared deeply about helping local businesses thrive and I appreciated their enthusiasm and guidance. I had the opportunity to work in each stage of the SME process; from meeting with clients (such as a hydroplant by Loch Lomond and a bakery near Fort William) to the analysis of their credit reports.
        <br/><br/>
        I also organised a number of client events across sectors and managed a small team of people to update the office newsletter and improve colleague-engagement across the office. In addition, all colleagues and interns are involved in the Charity Challenge - a Group wide competition among teams to raise money for charity - resulting in many wacky schemes for getting donations. 
        <br/><br/>
        In the meantime I soaked up the delights of Edinburgh, in particular the Fringe Festival, going to over 50 shows during the month!

        <div id="projects-txt-box">  <div id="txt"> <p class="white-big"> With the Departments of Psychology and Computer Science at Bristol University I completed a ten week research placement investigating the best method for locomoting robots to indicate their intended motion to the humans in their surroundings. 
    <br/> <br/>
        
    I worked with a partner to collect data for this project. We used 3D motion capture techonology to track participants movements as they negotiated a space with a robot, while the robot displayed different indications of its motion. <br/>
        <br/>
    The paper published from this research was: 'A Computational Model of Human-Robot Spatial Interactions Based on a Qualitative Trajectory Calculus'.    </p> </div> </div> </div>

        My first internship with Lloyds Banking Group and first experience of working in an office was with the Portfolio Management team in their London Headquarters. Their role is to manage the product relationships between the bank and other financial insitutions. A highly skilled team to be part of, I enjoyed learning about their process as well as finding out about how they are interconnected with the many other areas of the bank. 
        <br/><br/>
        As I was understandably not allowed to work on portfolios in the Â£millions region, I supported the team through minute-taking, organising the daily call and updating systems as well as supporting my boss and gaining an understanding of his role as manager.  
        <br/><br/>
        Principally, I developed a new proposal system for colleagues in other areas of the bank to use in order to assess portfolios by their products and risk-factors and direct them to the correct team.
