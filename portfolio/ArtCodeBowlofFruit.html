            <p class="p-font"> 
                
                This workshop has been an ongoing development with <a class="a-link-font" href="http://www.peteinfo.com/" target="_blank">Pete Bennett</a> and <a class="a-link-font" href="https://remented.com/portfolio/" target="_blank">Dave Webb</a>. It originated from chats in the pub with the Control Shift crowd, coming up with accessible workshops to engage people in using code to make art - particularly those who have never coded before. 
                <br/><br/>
                
                In the Art, code and a bowl of fruit sessions we go through the basics of creating your own version of Microsoft Paint using a programming language called <a class="a-link-font" href=" https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>. Having designed your set of paintbrushes we then take the code for a test spin with a life drawing session. Our first run of the workshop was at the <a class="a-link-font" href="https://www.watershed.co.uk/studio/" target="_blank"> Pervasive Media Studio</a>.

                During 2020 we converted the workshop to an online version on zoom as part of the <a class="a-link-font" href="https://www.control-shift.network/2020/index.html" target="_blank">Control Shift Festival</a>. For this workshop we had a big messy google doc that everyone could access so that people could share their artworks and their code with each other. It turned out to be a great way for everyone to share "paintbrushes" and ideas with one other and get to see each others creations. We set up a range of still lifes and human poses via the camera and held them for set durations like in a traditional life drawing session.
