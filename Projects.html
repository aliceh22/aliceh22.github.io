        <div id="projects-txt-box">  <div id="txt"> <p class="white-big"> Music is a key component of my everyday life and something I treasure. For my Masters thesis I decided to explore how I could make music more accessible to those with hearing impairments, who cannot experience music acoustically. To do this I investigated the use of sensory substitution to engender the same affective response in a user via haptics as they would have  when listening to the piece of music. <br/><br/>
            
    I designed, built and tested a wearable tactile interface in order to experiment with ideas. I generated mappings from audio tracks to vibration patterns, and assessed by how well they engendered the same affective response in the user as the music did. Two papers from my results are pending publication. <br/><br/>

        <div id="projects-txt-box"> <div id="txt"> <p class="white-big">  As part of a scholarship awarded to me by Bristol University, I chose to design and create a robot horse that could perform the four distinct gaits; walk, trot, canter and gallop. Horses move between the gaits for maximum efficiency according to their speed. However, in quadruped robots, simpler gaits are used to suit the mechanics available. I wanted to experiment with mimicking natural locomotion.
        <br/><br/>
    Using frame-by-frame analysis of horse locomotion footage I gathered data for the phase difference between all four legs. This was used to control the motors in the robot. The greatest challenge was to create transition patterns between each gait.
        <br/><br/>
    The robot was built using Arduino Motor Shields and stepper motors to control the leg movement. The casing was made with laser-cut acrylic, 3D printed connections and metal gears turned on a lathe.  </p> </div> </div> </div>

    <br/> <br/>
        
    I worked with a partner to collect data for this project. We used 3D motion capture techonology to track 20 participants' movements as they negotiated a space with a robot, while the robot displayed different indications of its motion. <br/>
